/*
Some wde backends (cocoa) require that this function be called in the
main thread. To make your code as cross-platform as possible, it is
recommended that your main function look like the the code below.

	func main() {
		go theRestOfYourProgram()
		wde.Run()
	}

wde.Run() will return when wde.Stop() is called.

For this to work, you must import one of the go.wde backends. For
instance,

	import _ "github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/xgb"

or

	import _ "github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/win"

or

	import _ "github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/cocoa"


will register a backend with go.wde, allowing you to call
wde.Run(), wde.Stop() and wde.NewWindow() without referring to the
backend explicitly.

If you pupt the registration import in a separate file filtered for
the correct platform, your project will work on all three major
platforms without configuration.

That is, if you import go.wde/xgb in a file named "wde_linux.go",
go.wde/win in a file named "wde_windows.go" and go.wde/cocoa in a
file named "wde_darwin.go", the go tool will import the correct one.
