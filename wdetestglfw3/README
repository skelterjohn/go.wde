go.wde/wdetest

This program can be used to test a new backend for go.wde. It opens
two windows with the title "hi", does a checkered color field that
changes every second or so, with a small white bar at the bottom, and
a black line from the top left corner (0, 0) to the bottom right
corner (200, 200). It reports a few events as they're received.
